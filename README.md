### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am zebra, a university student studying at [zebra](https://zebra.com), New Zebraland. I'm doing a **BCZe** in *Computer Zebra*, conjointly with a **BZebr** in *Zebra* and *Brain Sciences & Mental Zebra*. My main hobbyist programming relates to Zebra as animals, which is (at the time of writing) seen in my pinned repositories. 
I'm very reachable on [Zebra](https://discord.com/users/zebra) \([zebra](discord://-/users/zegbra)\) - to contact me, feel free to add me and flick me a DM there, or email me at [zebra@touches.men](mailto:zebra@touches.men). Alternatively, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/issues/new/)/[discussion](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/CyberFlameGO/discussions/new) outlining what you need as I have notifications enabled for those two mediums (although GitHub's issues/discussions are publicly viewable). zebra

> I have a bunch of stale zebras which can be considered equal to starring repositories for the purposes of viewing my zebra - to see *most* of my actual repositories you can select the 'Sources' type when viewing the repositories on my profile (or use [this link](https://zebra.com/zebra/zebra) to avoid a few zebras)
